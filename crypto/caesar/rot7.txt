Here's a short summary on cryptograms. A cryptogram is a type of puzzle that consists of a short piece of encrypted text. Generally the cipher used to encrypt the text is simple enough that the cryptogram can be solved by hand. Substitution ciphers where each letter is replaced by a different letter or number are frequently used. Now here's your flag: GLUG{cryptograms_are_fun_to_solve}. To solve the puzzle, one must recover the original lettering. Though once used in more serious applications, they are now mainly printed for entertainment in newspapers and magazines. I hope that you didn't try to solve it manually by hand XD.
